## HelloMatt

### App Description
This app was created in Android Studio as part of CodePath's Mobile App Design - Android Pre-work Project. This app initially displays "Hello from Matt!" to the user and has three buttons: one to change the text color, one to change the view color and one to change the text. When the "Change View Color" button is clicked, the background changes from pink to orange. When the "Change Text Color" button is clicked, the text color changes from black to blue. When the "Change Text" button is clicked, the text changes from whatever the original message is to whatever is written instead the text box above the message. If the text box is blank, the text will change to the message "Android is Awesome!". Clicking the background will revert everything back to it's default colors/text.
